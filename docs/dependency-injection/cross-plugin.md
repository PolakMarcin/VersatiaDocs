# Beans across plugins

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Beans marked `@ExposeSingleton` or `@ExposePrototype` can be injected into other plugins. This page
is written from the consumer's side; the providing plugin only has to pick the scope.

## Set-up in the consumer

Say the plugin **Shop** exposes `Clock` (a singleton) and `PluginSession` (a prototype).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="build-gradle-kts" label="build.gradle.kts">


```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.github.marcoral.versatia:VersatiaAPI:0.0.1")
    ksp("com.github.marcoral.versatia:VersatiaAPI-ksp:0.0.1")

    compileOnly("com.example:Shop:1.0.0")
}
```

1. `compileOnly`, never `implementation`: on the server the `Clock` class is loaded from the
   Shop plugin itself. Bundling a copy would create a second `Clock` class and break the
   injection with a `ClassCastException`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="plugin-yml" label="plugin.yml">


```yaml
depend:
  - VersatiaCore
  - Shop
```

Both entries matter. `VersatiaCore` provides the runtime and Kotlin; `Shop` guarantees that its
beans have been exposed before this plugin enables and lets Bukkit's class loader resolve
`Clock` from it.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="kotlin" label="Kotlin">


```kotlin
@LocalBean
class SessionReport(private val clock: Clock, private val session: PluginSession)

class ReportPlugin : VersatiaPlugin() {
    @AutoInvoke(EventType.PLUGIN_RELOAD_OR_START)
    fun summary(clock: Clock) {
        logger.info("Shared clock started at ${clock.startedAt}")
    }
}
```

Nothing marks `Clock` as foreign. It is requested like any other dependency.

## What the consumer receives

| Scope of the bean in Shop | The consumer gets                                                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `@ExposeSingleton`        | the instance Shop created, no copy                                   |
| `@ExposePrototype`        | a new instance made for this plugin; all of this plugin's injection points share it |
| `@LocalBean`              | nothing: local beans are invisible outside their plugin             |

A prototype is created by the owner's factory, with the constructor arguments the owner resolved at
its own start. In the log the line comes from Shop's class, but on behalf of the consumer.

## When the bean is missing

The processor cannot know what other plugins expose, so a dependency that no local bean provides
**compiles**. If nothing provides it at runtime either, the consumer fails to enable:

```
Error occurred while enabling ReportPlugin v1.0.0
EnhancementException: Plugin ReportPlugin: no bean provides com.example.shop.Clock,
    required by com.example.report.SessionReport
```

Bukkit disables that plugin and leaves the others running. Nothing was created before the failure:
beans are instantiated depth-first and the missing dependency is detected while resolving the first
bean that needs it. The same message appears for a typo in a class name or a provider plugin that is
not installed.

If two plugins expose the same type, the message lists them:

```
Plugin ReportPlugin: com.example.shop.Clock required by com.example.report.SessionReport is ambiguous;
candidates: "clock" (com.example.shop.Clock, from Shop), "clock" (com.example.other.Clock, from Other).
Add @Qualifier at the injection point or mark one bean @Primary
```

`@Qualifier` on the parameter picks one of them; see
[Names, qualifiers and primary beans](qualifiers.md).

## Lifetime across plugins

Exposed beans live as long as their owner. When Shop is disabled, its `Clock` and the
`PluginSession` factory disappear; since consumers list Shop under `depend:`, Bukkit disables them
first. A consumer enabled later sees whatever is exposed at that moment.

A worked example with two real plugins is in [Example plugins](../examples/index.md).
