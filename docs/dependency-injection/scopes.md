# Scopes and lifetime

## `@LocalBean`

```kotlin
@LocalBean
class PriceList(config: ShopConfig)
```

One instance, created when the plugin enables, injectable only into that plugin's own beans and
functions. Other plugins never see it, even if they list this plugin under `depend:`.

The plugin's main class is a local bean too, through `@PluginBean` on `VersatiaPlugin`; the
instance is the one Bukkit created. See [The plugin itself](index.md#the-plugin-itself).

## `@ExposeSingleton`

```kotlin
@ExposeSingleton
class Clock {
    fun now() = Instant.now()
}
```

One instance for the whole server. The declaring plugin creates it when it enables; every plugin
enabled afterwards that asks for `Clock` (or any of its supertypes) receives **the same instance**.

## `@ExposePrototype`

```kotlin
@ExposePrototype
class PluginSession(val clock: Clock) {
    val id = counter.incrementAndGet()
}
```

A factory rather than an instance. The declaring plugin gets its own `PluginSession`; every plugin
enabled afterwards that asks for one gets a **fresh instance, one per consuming plugin**. Within one
plugin all injection points share that single instance.

The factory reuses the constructor arguments that were resolved when the owner started. In the
example, the `Clock` handed to a new `PluginSession` is the one the owner resolved, so a consumer
does not need to provide (or even know) the prototype's dependencies. The owner's own instance is
never handed out.

## Processors

Each scope is interpreted by its own runtime processor, named in the annotation and recorded in
the descriptor:

| Scope               | Processor class in VersatiaCore                          |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `@LocalBean`        | `com.github.marcoral.versatia.di.LocalBeanEnhancementProcessor`       |
| `@ExposeSingleton`  | `com.github.marcoral.versatia.di.ExposeSingletonEnhancementProcessor` |
| `@ExposePrototype`  | `com.github.marcoral.versatia.di.ExposePrototypeEnhancementProcessor` |

All three run at `PLUGIN_START_ONLY`, and a scope that would send one of them another phase is a
compile error. The main class has a processor of its own, `PluginBeanEnhancementProcessor`,
behind `@PluginBean`. The names are kept in `BeanProcessors`.

## Lifetime

A plugin's beans, including the ones it exposes, live **exactly as long as the plugin**:

- They are created when the plugin enables, depth-first along the dependencies, after the whole
  descriptor has been read. That is why beans of all three scopes within one plugin may depend on
  each other freely.
- They are kept for the plugin's whole life. Functions running at reload or stop receive the same
  instances that were created at start; nothing is re-created on reload.
- They are dropped when the plugin disables, after its stop-phase functions ran. Exposed beans
  disappear with their owner.

Nothing is tied to server start. A plugin enabled later, for example through a plugin manager,
sees the exposed beans of the plugins running at that moment, and re-enabling a plugin replaces its
beans.

:::warning[Dependants and their providers]

Bukkit enables a plugin after everything under its `depend:` and disables it before them. List
the plugin whose beans you inject under `depend:` and the order is always right.

## Choosing a scope

| You want                                                | Use                 |
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| an internal collaborator                                | `@LocalBean`        |
| a shared service with one state for the whole server    | `@ExposeSingleton`  |
| per-plugin state or a per-plugin handle onto a shared service | `@ExposePrototype` |
